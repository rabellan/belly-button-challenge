UCB Extension Data Analytics Module 14 Challenge

This is an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Buton Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
